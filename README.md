A full-stack web application for managing student records, build using **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **MySQL**. 
the system allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) student information through a simple and responsive web interface.

##Technologies Used

- **Sping Boot Tool**
- **Java 17**
- **Thymeleaf**
- **MySQL / H2 (for testing)**
- **Maven**
- **JUnit 5 + Mockito** - Unit testing
- **PITest** -Mutation testing
- **Selenium** End-to-end testing
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent environments
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline
- **Sonar Cloud** - Code quality analysis
- **Codecov** - Code coverage reporting
- **JaCoCo** - Coverage generation

##Features

-Add new students via form
-View student list with live updates
-Edit or delete student records
-REST API endpoint alongside web views.
-Complete testing strategy: Unit, Integration, Mutation, and E2E

##Project Structure

-Model: Student entity and repository interface
-View: Thymeleaf templates (HTML)
-Controller: Handles web and REST API requests
-Service: Contains business logic
-Test: Includes unit, integration, mutation, and Selenium test cases

##Testing and Quality

-**Unit Testing** with JUnit 5 and Mockito
-**Integration Testing** using H2 database
-**Mutation Testing** with PITest
-**E2E Testing** using Selenium WebDriver
-**Coverage** report generated by JaCoCo and uploaded to Codecov
-**SonarCloud** for bug detection, code smells, and maintainability tracking

##CI/CD Pipeline

-**GitHub Actions** automates build, test, and analysis on each push
-**Docker** ensures consistent environments for local and CI
-**SonarCloud** and **Codecov** integrations provide live insights on quality and coverage

##Docker
